# Crop AI Project - Detailed File Explanation

## Overview
This is an intelligent agricultural recommendation system that uses artificial intelligence to help farmers make better decisions about crop selection, fertilizer usage, and profit estimation. The system analyzes soil conditions, weather data, and other factors to provide personalized recommendations.

## HOW EVERYTHING WORKS TOGETHER

1. **Data Flow**: Raw agricultural data goes into `data/raw/`, gets cleaned by `preprocess.py`, enhanced by `features.py`

2. **Model Training**: Training scripts (`train_*.py`) use processed data to create AI models stored in `models/`

3. **Prediction**: `predict.py` loads trained models and processes new requests to generate recommendations

4. **API Service**: `app.py` creates a web service that receives requests and returns predictions

5. **Explanations**: `explain.py` makes the AI's decisions understandable to users

6. **User Interface**: The API can be accessed through web browsers, mobile apps, or other software

## SYSTEM CAPABILITIES

**Input**: Soil nutrients (N, P, K), weather conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall), soil pH, farm area

**Output**: 
- Recommended crop with confidence level
- Fertilizer type and dosage recommendations
- Profit estimates and yield predictions
- Plain English explanations for all recommendations

**Use Cases**:
- Individual farmers planning their crops
- Agricultural consultants advising multiple clients
- Farm management software integration
- Research and policy analysis

---

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

The system uses:
- **Machine Learning**: LightGBM and XGBoost algorithms for predictions
- **Web API**: FastAPI framework for web service
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP library for decision explanations
- **Data Processing**: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for easy installation anywhere

This creates a complete, production-ready agricultural intelligence system that can be integrated into existing farm management workflows or used as a standalone recommendation service.
